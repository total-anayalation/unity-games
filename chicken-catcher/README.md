# The Chicken Cather game

This one is not a competitive game. It's like a fidget toy. You fidget, but you
get no points for doing so. You do it because it's calming. In this case, you nudge
the chicken so it starts bumping around. And then you try to catch it to make it still.

It's actually, what shall I say, therapeutic!
